## Welcome to my Capstone project for my Per Scholas Software Development 16 week bootcamp 🎊

### In order to showcase all of the skills I've learned on this journey, I have developed a full stack web app game for kids called Fantastical Pets. It allows users to choose 2 creatures and morph them into one. They can decide if they want to give their new pet a name and / or description. They can also add it to their collection see a gallery of all the pets they've created.
