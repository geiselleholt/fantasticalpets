## Welcome to my Capstone project for my Per Scholas Software Development training program 🎊

### In order to showcase all of the skills I've aquired on this 16 week learning journey, I have developed a full stack web app game for kids called Fantastical Pets. It allows users to choose 2 creatures and morph them into one cute critter. They can decide if they want to give their new pet a name and / or description. They can also add it to their collection see a gallery of all the pets they've created.

  - https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/text-generation

- DeepAI API for generating images (Also SO COOL 😎)

  - https://deepai.org/docs#ai-image-generator

- My classmate Mark Sianipar who inspired me to learn and use Tailwind with DaisyUI for styling and sharing his resources

- My instructor Dylan Comeau, @comeaudc, who walked us through developing a fullstack app from scratch including employing JWT and bcrypt as well as deployment. I refered to this repo A LOT

  - [TheGamesShop](https://github.com/comeaudc/TheGamesShopFE)

- My TA Constance Nwaigwe for giving me direction and answering all my questions

- StackOverFlow, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot (formerly Bing, not the Copilot that spoon feeds you code because that's plagiarism) for helping debug the 1 million errors I made and for verbage for content
